# Thoughtbot Chrome Extension Tutorial

This is the completed code from the [Thoughtbot Chrome Extension Tutorial](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-make-a-chrome-extension).
It uses a newer version of jQuery than specified in the article, but otherwise has the same code from that article.

When this extension is loaded, it adds a click listenr to the browser action. When that browser action is clicked, the extension finds the first link on the active tab and opens it in a new tab.

## Loading the extension

Follow the [install directions](https://github.com/ITPNYU/hacking-the-browser/blob/master/README.md#usage) on this repository's README.
