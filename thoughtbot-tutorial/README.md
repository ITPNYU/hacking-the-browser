# Thoughtbot Chrome Extension Tutorial

This is the completed code from the [Thoughtbot Chrome Extension Tutorial](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-make-a-chrome-extension).

To load this extension, use the "Load Unpacked" button on the chrome://extensions page. See [this slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qN4C0ewDV0uZDzXR4aHv-wBatBjYBY3Somla9ihux7w/edit#slide=id.g3655cdd7e2_0_111) for more details.

When this extension is loaded, it adds a click listenr to the browser action. When that browser action is clicked, the extension finds the first link on the active tab and opens it in a new tab.
