This extension example requires that you have a socket server running on your computer.
There is code for a node.js server in `socket-backend/`.

To run the server locally:

  * ensure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine
  * use the terminal to navigate to the `socket-backend/` folder
  * install the node dependencies by typing `npm install`
  * start the server: `node server.js`


**After** your socket server is running, your extension will work. Install it in
Chrome and you should see a log message in Chrome's console and a corresponding
log message in the terminal console that shows a message being sent from the server
to the extension and back.
