# Request Blocking Example

Adds several different conditional request-blockers:

  * Blocks facebook request (always)
  * Blocks reddit requests (before noon)
  * Redirects requests for bing.com to google.com
  * Redirect requests for images that have the text "dog" to an image of a cat

The [`background.js`](./background.js) file has detailed comments explaining usage.
