This extension demonstrates how to override one of the built-in Chrome pages.

It uses the "chrome_url_overrides" setting in manifest.json to override the newtab page,
replacing it with the newtab.html file.

Other pages that can be overriden are the bookmarks and history pages. In conjunction
with the chrome.bookmarks or chrome.history APIs, you could create a customize bookmark or history page.
