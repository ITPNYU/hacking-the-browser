    <!-- This background HTML page is here because the background.js
         file needs a DOM for it to use with Pixi to render the spinning
         rose.

         When the background script runs `renderPixi()` it will add a 
         canvas with id "pixi-canvas" to this body. The code later reads
         the image data out of that canvas to update the icon.
